<p> When looking at Batman's villains, the Joker is considered his arch-nemesis, but the painted clown isn't too different from the caped crusader's other green-donning villain The Riddler. Back in 2017, the Batman comics displayed a showdown between the two in an event called the "War of Jokes and Riddles". This entry's riddle and its answer are meant to poke fun at the Joker. The Riddler sees himself as absolute, so of course, someone who loves riddles would want to poke fun at something like jokes, which he probably finds inferior in every possible way.</p>
